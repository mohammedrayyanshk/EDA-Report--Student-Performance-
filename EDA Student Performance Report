Student Performance Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview

This project explores the factors influencing student performance using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We analyze a dataset containing information like study hours, attendance, parental involvement, and exam scores to uncover trends and understand how these factors relate to student success.

Categorizing Students by Grades

A Grade (90+ marks)
B Grade (80 - 89 marks)
C Grade (70 - 79 marks)
Below 70 (Needs Improvement)
Data Visualizations & Insights

Distribution of A-Grade Student Scores
